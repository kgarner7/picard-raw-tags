# Picard Raw Tags Plugin

A plugin for [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/) to show the raw tags of a file.

To use, install the plugin, right click on an item (file, matched track, album) > plugins, show raw tags.
A pop-up will show with all the tags.
Please note that these are not localized.
For performance reasons, non-string tags (e.g. cover art) will be truncated.
There are no current plans to show the images themselves.
